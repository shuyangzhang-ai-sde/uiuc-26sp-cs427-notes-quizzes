# CS 427: Software Engineering — Spring 2026, UIUC

Static study site for **CS 427: Software Engineering** (UIUC) — weekly notes with tabs, embedded mind maps, and interactive quizzes. Week HTML files live at the repo root next to `index.html`.

## Features

- **Home (`index.html`)** — Left rail lists course weeks; the main area loads the selected week in an **iframe**. URL hash `#week-id` selects the week (e.g. `#week-8`).
- **Per-week pages** — Split layout: notes (left) and quiz (right). Tabs for topics; some weeks embed a mind map under `mindmap/`.
- **Single source of weeks** — `js/study-weeks-config.js` defines `window.STUDY_WEEKS` (id, week number, HTML filename, label). Both the index nav and each week's sidebar use this list.

## Run locally

No build step. Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click or drag into a tab).

## Adding or editing a week

1. Add or update rows in `js/study-weeks-config.js` (`id`, `num`, `file`, `label`; use `file: null` and optional `soon: true` for placeholders).
2. Each week HTML should set `data-study-week` on `<body>` to the **same `id`** as in the config (e.g. `week-8`).
3. Include scripts at the bottom in line with existing weeks: `study-weeks-config.js`, `study-lang.js`, `study-sidebar.js` (and quiz scripts as needed).
